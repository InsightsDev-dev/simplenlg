SimpleNLG  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/delver/simplenlg.png)](http://travis-ci.org/delver/simplenlg)
=========

Simplenlg is a simple Java API designed to facilitate the generation of Natural
Language. It was originally developed at the 
[University of Aberdeen's Department of Computing Science](http://www.csd.abdn.ac.uk/).

This (mavenized) git repo is intended to shadow the latest source version from
https://code.google.com/p/simplenlg/, but augment the code with a maven pom.xml file with
http://repo.delver.io as the initial repository.

**Note:** No additional functionality (beyond Mavenization & Travis CI) will ever be added.
